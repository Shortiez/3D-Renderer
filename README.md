# 🖥️ Basic 3D Renderer

A simple little 3D renderer built with C++ and OpenGL, featuring Phong lighting and basic mesh rendering.

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Phong Lighting**: Implements ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting components.
- 🛠️ **Basic Mesh Rendering**: Uses a custom-built mesh library for rendering simple 3D models.
- 🎥 **Camera Movement**: Navigate the scene with intuitive controls.

## 📦 Installation

### 🔧 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- 🖥️ C++ compiler with C++17 support or later
- 🎮 OpenGL for graphics rendering
- 🪟 GLFW for window management
- 🔗 GLAD for OpenGL function loading

### 🏗️ Build Instructions

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Shortiez/Basic-3D-Renderer.git
cd Basic-3D-Renderer

# Create a build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Generate build files using CMake
cmake ..

# Compile the project
make

# Run the renderer
./renderer
```

## 🎮 Usage

- ⬆️⬇️⬅️➡️ **WASD**: Move the camera

## 🚀 Potential Future Improvements

- 🏗️ Support for more complex 3D models
- 🎭 Texture mapping capabilities
- 💡 Additional lighting techniques
- 🌑 Shadow mapping for improved depth perception
- 🛠️ UI controls for real-time light adjustments
- 🔗 GLAD for OpenGL function loading
